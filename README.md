### Unimportant Trivia
1. At first I was thinking of whether to call this list GET or MEDE, MEDE standing for Multimedia Fusion Extension Download Environment, and making a desktop app for it called GanyMEDE.
2. I made this HTML page for my personal page first, you can [see it here] (https://tropicalbananas.neocities.org/) or the [newer version using wordpress here] (https://tropicalbananas.altervista.org/)
